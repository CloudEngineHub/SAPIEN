Issues
====================

Continuous Joint
----------
How to elegantly record the angle of joints. Current joint angle are permitted only within [-6.28, 6.28]. How to deal with the continuous rotating command?
Currently, drive target can exceed this limit but joint angle will not.

Joint Force Limit
-----------
Currently only drive property has force limit? Can a joint has force limit?
